# DrivenDataConsulting

We make modern business intelligence available and easy to use for any size automotive company. We help the automotive industry tackle a problem that has persisted for over 30 years by combining all of their important data into one simple to use application. The 21,500 dealerships in Canada and the USA are still fighting their software whether it be CRM, Accounting, Inventory Management or Website to get the information they need to make the decisions that matter. The average manager in most of these companies spends nearly 20% of their time trying to figure out what reports to run and how to run them (not to mention the time to find meaningful information).

We simplify the data collection and delivery experience. We establish one version of the truth and make collaboration on important dealership metrics enjoyable. When employees get 20-25% of their day back to focus on actions versus gathering data, dealerships and their customers win.

With over 40 integration points for the average single dealership we are able to find the advanced relationships between areas like marketing engagement, pricing strategy and sales. Our dealerships are early adopters and are leaders in their respective markets. They embrace technology and seek new ways to improve their business. The people that work at their companies have been waiting for a long time for a tool that delivers, it is our job to enable their success by continuing to build the best analytics platform in the industry.
